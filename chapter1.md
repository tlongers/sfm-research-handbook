# Overview

The Google Sheet for every country is organized in the following sequence of tabs:

## Organizations (Police)
This sheet should be used for all non-military organizations, including: regular police, riot or otherwise specialized police forces, and government sanctioned irregular forces. As a rule of thumb, this sheet should include any organization whose main mission is concerned with internal security of a country.

## People (Police)
This sheet should be used to capture information about persons affiliated with organizations listed in the Organizations (Police) tab

## Organizations (Military)
This sheet should be used to capture information on army, naval, air and other military units of a country. Military operations - such as Joint Task Forces - should also be recorded here. As a rule of thumb this sheet should be used to include any organization whose main mission is concerned with defense of a country against external aggressors.

## People (Military)
This sheet should include any persons affiliated with organizations listed in the Organizations (Military) tab

## Events
All publicly documented events of gross human rights abuses (extrajudicial killings, torture, rape, beating, etc.) should be included here.
Researchers should code each event using the HURIDOCS standard which can be found here.

## Keywords
Researchers should refer to this sheet for keyword strings that they will use for their searches.
Researchers should also add to this list as appropriate

As the Google Sheets are a temporary situation as the Monitor moves to a full CMS - researchers should copy the keywords to the relevant Country Research Guide

Keyword searches should be identified with the database/source being used

## Sources Overview and tracking 
Contains a list of sources and tracks which sources have been put the different online tools (Internet Archive, Feedly, Import.io, etc.). This section of the Google Sheet should be added to as new sources are discovered.

## Bits of Thread
This sheet should be used for parking interesting pieces of information that do not clearly fit into the Monitor’s data structure but merit further investigation.

Researchers should quickly rank the suspected importance or relevance of a “bit of thread” as well as log their findings if further research is needed. If a piece of information is researched and determined to be of no value a researcher should change its ranking to 0 (zero) and write a short note about why the information was not useful
