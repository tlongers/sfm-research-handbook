# Sources
Sources are separated by a semicolon and generally follow this format: 


> title of article/website page. Name of publishing organization (country of organization). Date. url Internet Archive link: url



Example: Army parades oil bunkers in Kaduna. Premium Times (Nigeria). 8 May 2013. http://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/133295-army-parades-oil-bunkers-in-kaduna.html 
Internet Archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20140912060820/https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/nwest/133295-army-parades-oil-bunkers-in-kaduna.html#sthash.Fc0DTTxe.dpbs
We include the country information because, as shown in the example above, there could be a publication with the same name based in another country.
For the date we always use the ISO standard which mean DAY MONTH YEAR
If the source title contains a semicolon, just use everything in the title before the semicolon.
If the website you are using has been archived previously, use the oldest archive date url. For example, if the url was saved 2 times once in 2011 and once in  2013, use the url from 2011. 
You may come across a source citation that includes a link that is not available online anymore and there is no link for the Internet Archive. In this case, you can still try to look up the link in the Archive as someone could have saved it. For example, if you see the following citation - Army, Navy Redeploy Senior Officers. This Day (Nigeria). 13 February 2014. http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/army-navy-redeploy-senior-officers/171306/ - and you try to access the link, you'll get nowhere. When you look up the link in the Internet Archive, however, you'll find that it's been saved two times and you are thus able to access it. When you do that, don't forget to update the source citation so others can access the article without searching for it in the following way - Army, Navy Redeploy Senior Officers. This Day (Nigeria). 13 February 2014. http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/army-navy-redeploy-senior-officers/171306/ Internet Archive link: https://web.archive.org/web/20140307081703/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/army-navy-redeploy-senior-officers/171306
In this specific case you could also find the article on the AllAfrica.com server by looking up the title of the article in Google. This is because the parent website of the article is one of the websites archived by AllAfrica.com. However, if the article came from a source that AllAfrica.com doesn't cover, you'd still be able to access it via the Internet Archive (if it's been saved there before).
