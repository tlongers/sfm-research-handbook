#Persons

##ID
Please use this field to put your name/initials and date on rows you enter data on. In the future this field will be used to create an unique identifier for each person in the Monitor’s database.

## Name
Full name of the individual - whenever possible the most complicated/complete name is used, even if it has the least number of citations.

Use the name with the most characters e.g. “Magaji Musa Majia'a” instead of “Magaji Musa Majiaa”.

If an individual has held multiple positions within the security forces each position will require them to have a separate row.

The full CMS will make this easy to do - while it's being built as a temporary fix place a (1) after their name so the system knows that John Smith is promoted from Major to General --- or that John Smith serves with the 21 Battalion until 2011 when he was transferred to the 22 Brigade.

##Role
This column is to record the role the individual played in the organization that is usually not evident from their title or rank.

The main role we record - and that you will come across - is Commander.

There are a variety of other roles a person can have including Second in Command, Chief of Staff along with other less common entries. 

As a special note, heads of academic or other security force institutions will sometimes be referred to as the Commandant. They should be put in the Title column and they should be recorded as Commander.

If someone is referred to as “the head” of an unit or it’s “chief” or some other variation indicating that they are in charge - they should be regarded as the Commander
If someone is referred to as “Spokesperson” and the source does not state that this person is a “Police Public Relations Officer” then the Role of that person is “Spokesperson”.

*Vice versa*, if in Nigeria for example, someone is listed as Police Public Relations Officer their role is also Police Public Relations Officer.
